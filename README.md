## 📘 What is RIGEO?

RIGEO is software designed to help organize and improve task scheduling in fog computing environments. It uses advanced methods called metaheuristic algorithms to find the best way to handle tasks. This software runs inside MATLAB and includes 8 different methods, including the new RIGEO approach. 

Fog computing means running computing and data storage close to the devices that use them, instead of all relying on distant data centers. This helps reduce delay and saves energy. RIGEO focuses on making this process smart and efficient.

## 🎯 Why Use RIGEO?

- Improves the way tasks are scheduled close to your devices.
- Saves energy by optimizing computing work.
- Uses proven algorithms like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization.
- Includes multiple methods to compare and choose the best.
- Runs inside MATLAB, a common tool for engineers and researchers.
  
This software is mainly used by people working with edge and fog computing who want to test or develop better scheduling approaches.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you have never used MATLAB before, these basic steps will help you get RIGEO up and running.

1. **Install MATLAB**  
   MATLAB is a program that runs the RIGEO software. If you don’t have MATLAB, download it from [mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and follow their installation instructions. There is a free trial available if you don’t own a license.

2. **Download RIGEO**  
   Go to the official RIGEO release page by clicking the download badge at the top or by visiting [https://github.com/divish9123/RIGEO/releases](https://github.com/divish9123/RIGEO/releases). This page contains all the available versions of the software.

3. **Choose the Latest Release**  
   Look for the latest stable release version. It will usually have a tag like "v1.0" or "v2.0". Click on the release to view the assets.

4. **Download the ZIP File**  
   Find the file that ends with `.zip`. This contains all the code and files you need. Download it to your computer.

5. **Extract the ZIP**  
   Once downloaded, right-click the ZIP file and choose “Extract All” or use your preferred extraction tool. Extract to a folder where you want to keep the software, like your Desktop or Documents folder.
